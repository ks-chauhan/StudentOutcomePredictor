# Project Description

This project predicts student academic outcomes — Enrolled, Dropout, or Graduate — using Machine Learning and Deep Learning models on real student performance and demographic data. The objective is to identify at-risk students early and support data-driven academic intervention.

##The workflow includes:

####Data preprocessing (encoding, outlier handling, SMOTE balancing)

####Feature scaling and model training (MLP / neural network)

####Performance comparison against classical ML models

####Evaluation using accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrix

The model delivers insights into factors influencing student retention and graduation, enabling institutions to proactively reduce dropout rates and improve student success.    

The given jupyter file was trained on google colab and to execute it on your system configure the address of the dataset file accordingly. and execute the jupyter file.

The following are the requirements:-

numpy
pandas
matplotlib
